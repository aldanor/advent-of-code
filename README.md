# Advent of Code 2018 (Rust)

All solutions are heavily optimized (even if it means sacrificing some of
the nicety).

Timings (on a 2013 3.5GHz i7):

```
test day01::bench_day01_1 ... bench:      17,735 ns/iter (+/- 2,218)
test day01::bench_day01_2 ... bench:   1,136,476 ns/iter (+/- 42,996)
test day02::bench_day01_1 ... bench:      18,783 ns/iter (+/- 647)
test day02::bench_day01_2 ... bench:     136,027 ns/iter (+/- 51,168)
```
